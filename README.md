# Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic

Data collection - Cognitive-Affective Map Extended Logic (C.A.M.E.L.): C.A.M.E.L. is an open-source software to draw Cognitive-Affective Maps. It aims to offer people an easy and intuitive interface on which they could draw their own mind map within online studies. There is a participant view and a researcher view to set up studies. Currently it is possible to change 11 parameters of the C.A.M.E.L. software (e.g. force to full screen, or change language to Chinese).




# CAM-App

Data analysis - CAM-App: Using multiple modules you can summarize your CAM data semi-automatically (e.g. sophisticated language models are implemented) and the so summarized can subsequently be analyzed using multiple implemented functions, e.g. aggregating CAMs or compute over 30 network indicators. 

# Administrative panel

Set up studies â€“ dashboard: We set up an administrative panel to set up and configure CAM studies easily and guarantee highest privacy standards (hosted on university BW-cloud).
