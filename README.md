# Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic

The Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the relationships between cognitive and affective concepts. It provides a framework for representing complex mental models and understanding the dynamics of thoughts and emotions.
The CAM-App is a user-friendly interface that allows researchers and participants to create, edit, and explore Cognitive-Affective Maps. It provides various features such as drag-and-drop functionality, customizable node and edge properties, and interactive visualization options.
The Administrative panel is a centralized hub for managing CAM studies. It allows administrators to create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and track study progress. It also provides tools for data analysis and export.
For additional resources and support, please refer to the following:
We hope you find these resources helpful in using the Cognitive-Affective Map tools effectively. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
