**CAMs for conflict resolution / mediation**

* CAMs analyzed as a mediating tool by letting participants draw a CAM about a fictional technological implant and before they had to draw a second CAM one week later, they were shown a CAM contrary to their own on the same topic[@gros_camediaid_2021]
* CAMs to illustrate individuals’ concepts and beliefs on the exemplary topics of (1) German housing policy, (2) the Israelis’ meaning of the Western Wall, (3) the exploitation of Canada’s bitumen resources, and (4) climate change for conflict analysis[@homer-dixon_conceptual_2014] 
* CAMs to describe cultural thought and to highlight relevant cultural differences and for conflict resolution[@thagardMappingMindsCultures2012]
* CAMs are presented as a method to depict individual and collective beliefs for conflict analysis (e.g., to locate points of difference and emotionally loaded concepts)[@mockIdeologicalConflictProject2015]
* CAMs to analyze the emotional changes in the 1978 Camp David negotiations by modeling the mental states of Sadat and Begin based on Carter’s memoirs[@findlayEmotionalChangeInternational2014]


**CAMs to depict belief systems / political ideologies**

* CAMs as a part of a complex system approach to study ideologies as conceptual networks of cognitive-affective representations embedded in social networks of people (among other methods like connectionist simulations and agent-based modeling)[@homer-dixon_complex_2013]
* CAMs on the basis of in-depth interviews with diplomats/nonstate actors to compare belief structures about climate change[@milkoreitMindmadePoliticsCognitive2017]
* CAMs created by researchers on the basis of Reddit posts for understanding political ideologies (masculinity, shame, injustice)[@clappMappingComparingPolitical2021]
* CAMs for showing the structure of ideologies, e.g., mapping Nazi, anarchist, and right-wing ideologies; also, multi-modal CAMs with nonverbal representations are suggested[@thagardCognitiveAffectiveStructure2015]
* CAMs to model the appeal of ideologies to their supporters, exemplified by attitudes towards transgender rights (coherent with left-wing ideologies, incoherent with right-wing ideologies)[@thagardSocialEqualityCognitive2018]



**CAMs for applied ethics**

* CAMs as a tool for applied ethics; difference between CAMs at the beginning and end of the semester were analyzed (topic: nature imitation in technology development)[@hofeleConnectingMethodsPsychology2022]
* CAMs as a method for applied ethics to map students’ values on controversial topics[@thagard_value_2014]
* Applying the multi-coherence theory, which serves as a comprehensive constraint satisfaction framework that unifies various ethical principles, allowing for the simultaneous assessment of multiple principles and the management of ethical conflicts in a context-sensitive manner[@yilmazComputationalModelsEthical2017]
* Theory of ethical coherence[@thagard_ethical_1998]


**CAMs for qualitative analysis (no network parameters)**

* CAMs to reveal individuals’ (change of) emotions, values, beliefs and norms within a water community / network and to find potential for addressing embedded innovation barriers[@wolfe_water_2012]
* CAMs drawn in combination with and on the basis of SAKD (sociology of knowledge approach to discourse) to reconstruct typical patterns of knowledge, practices, and forms of subjectivation (topic: stimulation interactions in day care-centers)[@luthardt_and_2020]


**CAMs for quantitative analysis / mixed research**

* Changes between pre- and post CAMs by 66 participants (topic: corona pandemic; intervention: leisure walking) were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively[@reuter_leisure_2021]
* CAMs of 111 participants (topic: carbon tax in Canada) were analyzed quantitatively (can the graphs’ emotional and structural properties predict participants’ tax support)[@mansell_measuring_2021]
* CAMs of 193 participants (topic: corona pandemic) were analyzed quantitatively (can the graphs’ emotional and structural properties predict the perceived coronavirus threat)[@mansell_novel_2021]
* CAMs of 58 participants and of 600 participants (only survey data) regarding the acceptability and ethical concerns of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively[@fennIdentifyingKeypsychologicalFactors2023]
